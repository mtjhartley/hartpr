	<h1>About</h1>
	<p class="left_align">The HartPR is a competitive ranking system and tournament archive for the game Super Smash Bros. Melee, created by Michael Hartley and Mitch Dzugan. The goal of our site is to provide an objective indicator of a player's current rank in the Washington Melee community as well as their comprehensive in-state tournament history.</p>

	<h2>Ranking System</h2>
	<p class = "left_align"> We rank players using the <a href="http://trueskill.org/">Python implementation</a> of the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/">Microsoft Trueskill</a> ranking algorithm. 
	Trueskill only takes set wins and losses into account; game counts are not used in the ranking formula but are archived on our site as interesting data. Our system currently supports processing <strong>finished</strong> brackets from <a href="https://help.smash.gg/hc/en-us/articles/217471947-API-Access">SmashGG</a> and <a href="https://api.challonge.com/v1">Challonge.</a> Brackets are processed every Tuesday.</p> 

	<h3>The Numbers</h3>
	<p class = "left_align"> The numbers on your 
	<a href="{{url_for('player',player_id=200)}}">player page</a>
	indicate your skill relative to the rest of the community. Your unadjusted skill is comprised of two key indicators; MU and SIGMA. MU increases and decreases as you win and lose sets, and represents an average approximation of skill. SIGMA starts off large and decreases as you play more sets, and represents how uncertain we are that your skill lies around said approximation. Game counts are archived when possible and displayed on player pages, but only <strong>set</strong> wins and losses are used in the calculation.</p>

	<p class = "left_align">
	The Trueskill number takes your MU and SIGMA and uses Microsoft's suggested ranking formula of: Trueskill = MU - (3 * SIGMA). You can read more about Trueskill <a href="http://www.moserware.com/2010/03/computing-your-skill.html">here.</a></p>

	
	<h3>Limitations of HartPR</h3>
	<p class ="left_align">
	Our ranking system has several limitations. Skilled out of state players are ranked with less accuracy due to a smaller sample of attended WA tournaments. Thus, wins or losses against OOS players may not change your Trueskill as drastically as you might expect.
	</p>


	<p class ="left_align">
	The tournament archive only dates back to the beginning of 2016. We decided upon this date after somewhat futilely searching various challonge users for brackets before 2016. The addition of those brackets to our archive would skew the rankings in favor of the old, possibly out dated and irrelevant results, which we do not want to represent. HartPR rankings aim to be a current snapshot of your rank in the community, bolstered by your attendance and performance at tournaemnts.

	</p>

	<p class ="left_align">Furthermore, Challonge brackets often have misspelled tags and joke names. Our program <strong>can</strong> catch misspelled tags to a certain degree of accuracy, but is not perfect. If we are unfamiliar with the joke tag you are entering as, the tag will be entered as a new player entity in our database and your Trueskill will not be accurately updated until I am informed of this error and the players are merged. If you have any player merge requests, please fill out ourÂ <a href="{{url_for('submit_form_unsubmitted')}}">contact form</a>.
	</p>

	<p class ="left_align">
	Lastly, unfinished challonge brackets are not currently supported by our system. If you are hosting or even entering results into the bracket while at a tournament, please ensure that the tournament is officially completed on Challonge! 
	</p>

	<h2>Included Tournaments</h2>
	<p class="left_align">We aim to include all paid tournaments within the Western Washington region in our archive. Free tournaments such as UW Smash PR tournaments and smaller tournaments that lack top player representation such as SU weeklies and house tournaments are not included. If you find tournaments that are not listed in our archive, please fill out our <a href="{{url_for('submit_form_unsubmitted')}}">form</a> and we will work on getting them added.</p>

	<ul class="left_align" style="list-style: none;">
		<li>Weeklies:</li>
		<li class="left_align">Sunday: East Side Smash - Bellevue</li>
		<li class="left_align">Monday: Gameclucks(RIP) - Lynnwood</li>
		<li class="left_align">Wednesday: Brackets &amp; Brews - Redmond</li>
		<li class="left_align">Thursday: ePG Smash at The Training House (bi-weekly) - Renton</li>
		<li class="left_align">Friday: Tuk House Tournament - Tukwilla</li>

	<h2>Submitting Player Characters</h2>
	<p class="left_align">At this time, neither SmashGG or Challonge has the information within a tournament bracket to allow us to know which character you play. Adding the stock head icon next to a tag on either the index and player page requires manual input from us. If you would like your character to be represented next to your name, fill out our <a href="{{url_for('submit_form_unsubmitted')}}">form</a> and select "Add my character/color".</p>

	<h2>Managing Alternate Tags</h2>
	<p class="left_align">Players entering tournaments with different tags can be merged in our system. However, we will not actively hunt down players who choose to enter under fake tags. If you want your ranking to represented in an accurate and timely fashion, please enter as your normal tag. If you have any player merge requests, please fill out our <a href="{{url_for('submit_form_unsubmitted')}}">contact form.</a></p>

	<h2>Handling Inactive Players</h2>
	<p class="left_align">The Washington Power Ranking Panel has designated an activity requirement of 4 tournaments within the ranking period (3-4 months)to be eligible for PR. We use a similar but more variable requirement based on the frequency of tournaments occuring within our region. Generally, we require one tournament within the past month to be considered active. If you do not meet this requirement, you will be hidden from the global ranking page but still searchable on our site.</p>
